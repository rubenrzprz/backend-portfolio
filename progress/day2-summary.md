# Day 2 – Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- [x] Practice a disciplined Git workflow (feature branch → micro-commits → PR → squash merge)
- [x] Refactor and style README with clear phases, structure, and usage
- [x] Establish repo standards (PR template, commit guidelines, issue templates)
- [x] Document outcomes and prepare for Day 3

---

## 🧩 Tasks Completed
- **README**
  - Refactored structure (phases, Phase 1 overview, repository layout, core tech, how to use)
  - Added styling polish (icons/dividers) and improved scannability
  - Fixed placeholders and verified links (Project Board, clone URL)
  - Merged via **Squash & merge** (PR A)
- **Repo standards**
  - Added **PR template** (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
  - Added **Commit Guidelines** (`GIT_COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md`) incl. closing vs non-closing references
  - Added **Issue templates** (`task.md`, `bug.md`, `standards.md`, `config.yml`)
  - Added optional **.gitmessage** and usage instructions
  - Merged via **Squash & merge** (PR B, Closes #17; Refs #2)
- **Process**
  - Prepared this **Day 2 summary** (PR C) to close the tracking issue (#2)

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used
- Git & GitHub (feature branches, PRs, squash merges)
- GitHub Projects (Issues ↔ PRs; To Do / Doing / Done)
- IntelliJ IDEA, Markdown

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings / Insights
- Keep commits **atomic**; separate content (`docs`) from presentation (`style`).
- Put `Closes #id` in the **PR description** (or squash message) to be merge-strategy agnostic; use `Refs #id` for intermediate work.
- Prefer **Squash & merge** for a clean, linear history; practice rebase locally to keep branches up-to-date.
- Templates (PR/Issue) + commit guidelines reduce ambiguity and speed up reviews.
- Safe rollback before publishing: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Day 3 plan)
- **Branching & sync practice:** create `feature/git-practice`, do 5 micro-commits, and practice `git pull --rebase` (compare with `git merge` locally for learning only).  
- **Policy documentation:** add `GIT_GUIDELINES.md` (branch naming; rebase-preferred sync; **Squash & merge** policy; cleanup rules).  
- **Licensing:** add **LICENSE** (MIT) in a tiny, separate PR.  
- **Repository topics:** log a small task issue to set topics (e.g., `java`, `rest-api`, `sql`, `docker`, `spring-boot`) and complete it.

---

## 📂 Deliverables
- ✅ Updated and styled `README.md`  
- ✅ Standards added: PR template, commit guidelines, issue templates, `.gitmessage`  
- ✅ PR A (README) merged; PR B (standards) merged  
- ✅ This summary prepared (PR C) — use it to close **#2** after merge

> _Reflection:_ Established a repeatable workflow: branch → micro-commits → PR (template) → squash merge → progress log. Standards now enforce consistency for all future work.
