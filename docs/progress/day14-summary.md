# Day 14 – Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Finalize **Phase 1 documentation** and mark the backend-portfolio repository as stable (`v0.1.0`).
* Add a **Phase 2 Projects** section in the main README linking to the new **ResHub** repository.
* Prepare the **Phase 1 completion checklist** and the **Phase 2 plan** (4-week roadmap).
* Set clear milestones and reminders for the transition into Phase 2 development.

---

## 🧩 Tasks Completed

* **Documentation Polishing**

    * Reviewed and standardized all docs: `README`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/sql.md`, and `docs/progress/`.
    * Fixed internal anchors, headings, and formatting consistency.
    * Verified all links (Postman, Mermaid, progress logs) render correctly on GitHub.
    * Added a clean “Docs → Progress” index for quick access to daily summaries.

* **Phase 2 Integration**

    * Updated the **main README** with a new section titled “Phase 2 Projects”:

        * **ResHub** — Hotel Reservation Management System (Spring Boot showcase).
        * **StockBox** — AI-assisted stock insights API.
        * Optional: Streaming microservice (experimental project).
    * Linked the new **ResHub repository** (`rubenrzprz/reshub`) from the main README.

* **Checklists & Planning**

    * Created `docs/progress/phase1-checklist.md` — complete summary of all Phase 1 deliverables.
    * Added `docs/progress/phase2-plan.md` — 4-week structured roadmap for November (Week 1–4 milestones).
    * Added personal calendar reminders for Week 1 (ResHub setup) and Week 4 (demo and reflection).

* **Repository Updates**

    * Committed and pushed all updated docs.
    * Verified repo cleanliness — no untracked files, no pending changes.
    * Tagged Phase 1 officially as **`v0.1.0` (completed)** milestone.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Proper documentation closure ensures the repository can act as a **long-term portfolio artifact**.
* Linking future projects creates a natural progression from foundation → specialization.
* Breaking large goals (like Phase 2) into weekly milestones keeps motivation high and scope realistic.

---

## 📂 Deliverables

* Updated **README.md** with “Phase 2 Projects” section and ResHub link.
* `docs/progress/phase1-checklist.md` – full Phase 1 deliverable list.
* `docs/progress/phase2-plan.md` – 4-week roadmap for November.
* Finalized and committed all Phase 1 documentation updates.

✅ **Phase 1 officially closed — Phase 2 begins with ResHub initialization.**
