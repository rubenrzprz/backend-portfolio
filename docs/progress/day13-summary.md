**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Practice structured, confident storytelling within the **60–90 second** window.
* Keep all final scripts and recordings **private**, logging only neutral progress in the repository.

## 🧩 Tasks Completed

* **Prompt Selection**

    * Chose 6 high-frequency behavioral questions covering:

        1. Reliability under pressure
        2. Debugging and problem-solving
        3. Handling ambiguity
        4. Managing deadlines and scope
        5. Documentation and ownership
        6. Failure and learning

* **STAR Answer Drafting**

    * Wrote 6 concise answers following the **STAR scheme**:

      ```
      Situation (10s) → Task (10s) → Action (3 bullets, 45–60s) → Result (10–15s)
      ```
    * Each includes a **proof hook** (e.g., PR reference, CI run success, README mention).
    * Revised for spoken flow using the **connector script**:
      “Because {Situation}, I owned {Task}. To fix it, I did three things:

        1. {Action 1}, 2) {Action 2}, 3) {Action 3}. As a result, {Result}.”

* **Self-Summary & Recording**

    * Created a **30–45s self-summary** introducing professional background, strengths, and a recent project highlight.
    * Practiced and recorded both:

        * Self-summary
        * One full STAR story (best example selected)
    * Polished timing and tone through 2–3 takes for natural pacing.

* **Storage & Privacy**

    * All written and recorded assets stored securely in private storage (Drive/Notion).
    * Public repo note added to `docs/progress/day13-summary.md` to confirm completion without revealing content.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* The STAR format ensures **structured, concise delivery** while keeping answers human and story-driven.
* Having a **proof hook** elevates credibility — turning claims into verifiable experiences.
* Practicing aloud helps refine **timing, confidence, and flow**, especially under mock interview pressure.

---

## 📂 Deliverables

* 6 STAR-formatted answer scripts (≤120 words each).
* 1 self-reading summary script.
* 2 recordings: **self-summary** + **one STAR story**.
* All assets stored privately, with progress logged in `docs/progress/day13-summary.md`.
