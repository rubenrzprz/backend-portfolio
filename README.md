# Backend Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of backend development exercises, mini-projects, and learning checkpoints. It demonstrates skills in **Java, Node.js, SQL, REST APIs, Git workflows, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines**. It also serves as a living record of a structured **14-day Phase 1 backend learning sprint**.
