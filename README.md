# Backend Portfolio

Focused backend engineering growth — disciplined practice, traceable outcomes. This repository documents a structured journey to build mastery in **Java, SQL, REST APIs, and DevOps fundamentals** while developing professional workflow and portfolio discipline.

## 🗺️ Development Phases Overview

The path is organized into **three progressive phases**. Phase 1 is executed now; Phases 2–3 define the forward vision.

- **Phase 1 — Foundation & Positioning (Weeks 1–2)**  
    Polish fundamentals; build a clean public presence and materials.  
    **Focus:** Git discipline (branching/commits/PRs), REST design + Postman, SQL (joins, subqueries, indexes, normalization), personal brand (CV, LinkedIn, pinned projects, mission). 
- **Phase 2 — Proof of Skill & Portfolio (Weeks 3–6)**  
    Demonstrate capability via 1–2 small, complete backend projects.  
    **Focus:** Spring Boot (Java) projects (e.g., task manager API); optional second project (e.g., financial tracker with auth); deploy to Render/Railway/Heroku; add tests + CI (GitHub Actions); strong READMEs.
- **Phase 3 — Professional Execution (Weeks 6–12)**  
    Consolidate production practices and present a hire-ready portfolio.
    **Focus:** polish documentation, harden CI/CD, add monitoring/observability notes, and prepare targeted, evidence-based case studies of the projects delivered in Phases 1–2.

### 📅 Phase 1 Overview (14 Days)

- **Days 1–3:** Git workflow, branching strategy, commit conventions, PR practice.
- **Days 4–5:** REST fundamentals; CRUD endpoints; status codes; error handling.
- **Days 6–7:** SQL fundamentals; DB schema; integrate DB with API.
- **Day 8:** Dockerize app; local stack with `docker-compose`.
- **Days 9–10:** CV, LinkedIn, portfolio polish (documentation and presentation).
- **Days 11–14:** Basic CI with GitHub Actions; job materials; interview prep; Phase 2 plan.
